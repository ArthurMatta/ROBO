# Assignment 3 & 4

This is the repository for Assignment 3 and 4 of the Robotics curricular unit at FEUP. 

The objective of these assignments is the development of a Cat & Mouse game. The first should chase and capture the second whilst the second should avoid being captured.

To that end, two robots were developed using the Robotic Operational System (ROS) and the Gazebo Simulator environment.

## Pre-requisites & Setup

In order to execute the game it's necessary to have ROS (melodic version) and Gazebo (gazebo and gazebo_ros packages) installed. The installation guide for ros, gazebo and gazebo_ros packages can be found (here)[http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation], (here)[http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install], and (here)[http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros] respectively.
